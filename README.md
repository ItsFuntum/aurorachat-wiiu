## How to use
The Wii U Client is still in development but if you would like to test it before release you could download [aurorachat.elf](aurorachat.elf) or [aurorachat.rpx](aurorachat.rpx) and load it natively on a Wii U or in Cemu

Alternatively you can clone the repository and make your own build
