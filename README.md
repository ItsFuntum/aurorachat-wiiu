## How to use
The Wii U Client is still in development but if you would like to test it before release you could download [aurorachat-wiiu.elf](https://github.com/ItsFuntum/aurorachat-wiiu/raw/refs/heads/main/aurorachat-wiiu.elf) or [aurorachat-wiiu.rpx](https://github.com/ItsFuntum/aurorachat-wiiu/raw/refs/heads/main/aurorachat-wiiu.rpx) and load it natively on a Wii U or in Cemu

Alternatively you can clone the repository and make your own build
